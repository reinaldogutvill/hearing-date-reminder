# Immigration Court Hearing Reminder App

A bilingual, accessible web app to help immigrants in removal proceedings receive timely court hearing reminders via email. Built with **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and **SendGrid**, this app is designed for use through pro bono services, community orgs, and directly by individuals facing immigration court dates. In a practical setting, the respondent in question would be notified and integrated to the reminder system after they have received their hearing date in court.

This project was built by an individual named Reinaldo with the support of AI-assisted development using OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT.

All core design, direction, and social-legal context were created by a human. ChatGPT was used as a development assistant â€” helping to implement features, debug errors, and accelerate technical learning during development.
